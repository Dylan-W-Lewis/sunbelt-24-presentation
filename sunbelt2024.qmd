-   Changing health behaviours amongst young people

    -   Declining alcohol and tobacco consumption

    -   Growing prevalence of poor mental health

Have patterns of peer level clustering of health behaviours changed?

Do the same relationships between network structure and health behaviours observed in older datasets occur in a contemporary Scottish adolescent population?

## Measures {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="33.3%"}
-   *Dependent variables:*

    -   General mental health (GHQ-12 caseness)

    -   Self-esteem (Rosenberg scale, binarised)

    -   Smoking (monthly or more often)

    -   Drinking (weekly or more often)

    -   Drugs (used this year)
:::

::: {.column width="33.3%"}
-   *Individual attributes:*

    -   Gender

    -   Family affluence (FAS)

    -   Parental care, parental control (Bonding Instrument BF)
:::

::: {.column width="33.3%"}
-   *Network ties*

    -   Net4Health:

        -   Asked to nominate up to **ten** friends.

        -   Two year-group networks per school = 10 networks.

    -   PaLS:

        -   Asked to nominate up to **six** friends.

        -   22 networks.

## ALAAMs {.smaller}

We used *autologistic actor-attribute models*^[Daraganova & Robins, 2013] (ALAAMs) to examine how the behaviour (nodal attribute) of an individual is related to their **position in a social network** and by the **behaviours/attributes of other actors** in that network.

-   ALAAMs are an extension of ERGMs.

-   Can be interpreted similarly to a logistic regression, but taking into account network dependencies.

-   Sometimes called *social influence models*.^[Robins, Pattison, & Elliott, 2001]

    -   While we can include 'contagion' parameters, we can't distinguish between influence and selections!


## Plan of analysis {.smaller}

Missing data

::: custom-box
-   Attributes imputed with *mice* R package
-   Missing DVs handled by ALAAM\
:::

ALAAMs

::: custom-box
-   Run in R using *bayesALAAM* ^[Koskinen & Daraganova, 2020] 
-   2 models for each network
    -   A: just structural parameters
    -   B: structural parameters + attributes\
:::

Meta-analysis

::: custom-box
-   Model estimates combined in mixed-effects meta-regression using *metafor* R package
-   Study effect (Net4Health or PaLS) included as a moderator
:::

## Model specification

![](model_diagram.png)

## Initial results

*A couple of caveats...*

-   These are the results from a *single imputation*

-   Only structural parameters included so far ('model A')

-   Work in progress!

## Results - Drinking

```{r drinking, echo=FALSE}
plots <- readRDS("sunbelt_plots.RDS")

plots$drinking_outcome
```

## Results - Smoking

```{r smoking, echo=FALSE}
plots$smoking_outcome
```

<!-- ## Results - Drug use -->

<!-- ```{r drugs, echo=FALSE} -->
<!-- plots$drugs -->
<!-- ``` -->

## Results - Poor mental health (GHQ)

```{r ghq, echo=FALSE}
plots$GHQ
```

<!-- ## Results - Low self esteem -->

<!-- ```{r se, echo=FALSE} -->
<!-- plots$SE -->
<!-- ``` -->

## Conclusions {.incremental}

-   Some evidence for peer-level clustering of health-related behaviours
      
    -   Smoking behaviours in both time-periods, drinking only in PaLS (2005/6)
    
-   Poor mental health was not strongly related to network structure at either time-period

-   Despite changing prevalence and societal contexts of health-related behaviours, network dependencies do not differ greatly between the time-periods
